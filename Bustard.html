The great Indian bustard is a large ground bird with a height of about one metre. 
It is unmistakable with its black cap contrasting with the pale head and neck. The body is brownish with a 
black patch spotted in white. The male is deep sandy buff coloured and during the breeding season has a black breast band. 
The crown of the head is black and crested and is puffed up by displaying males. In the female which is smaller than the male,
 the head and neck are not pure white and the breast band is either rudimentary, broken or absent
 Among bustards, this species is smaller only than the Kori bustard and the great bustard in size. It
 is also the largest land bird in its native range. The great Indian bustard stands at about 1 m (3.3 ft) tall, 
 having a somewhat long neck and quite long legs.
