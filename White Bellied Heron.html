<h1>White Bellied Heron</h1>

The White Bellied Heron is the 2nd largest Heron species in the world, standing at around 4 feet. One of India’s rarest and seldom seen birds, they are globally threatened.
The White Bellied Heron inhabits forests of India, Bhutan and Myanmar. It has not been reported in Nepal since the 19th Century and declared extinct.
The first evidence of the White-bellied Heron nesting in India was discovered in 2014, when, during the Tiger Census – it was discovered in Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh. The only other records are in the state of Assam. 
It survives in the foothills of the Himalayas and requires large and open fast-flowing rivers to survive. They are able to catch fish moving in the river’s current. This makes it the only heron species in the world which displays this behaviour.
This bird also is very secretive, easily spooked by human presence. Human pressure on the park, and resultant fishing and sand-mining are affecting the species which are anyway only present in a small handful in India.
