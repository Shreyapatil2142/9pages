The Jerdon’s Courser is a bird from the Pratincole family, endemic to the Eastern Ghats in India and was believed to be extinct until rediscovery in the year 1986! The last photographic record is from 2008 however.
Its closest cousins are the Three-banded Courser and the Bronze-winged Courser, found in Africa.
The Jerdon’s Courser is believed found currently in the Telangana and Andhra Pradesh States of India. Records presently are only at the Sri Lankameshwara Wildlife Sanctuary. There are believed to be between 50 and 200 individuals in the wild, as surveys have shown.
The Jerdon’s Courser inhabits open patches of Scrub Forest and are interestingly a nocturnal species – hence the limited sightings and understanding of the behaviour of this bird.
They are insectivorous in nature, and prefer to get away with their feet rather than fly away when confronted with danger.
